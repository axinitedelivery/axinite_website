AXINITE SYSTEM | ADS TERMS OF SERVICE

Version: 1.1.1  
Effective Date: January 2026
Service: Axinite Design System Infrastructure
Provider: Miki G. (independent operator)

________________________________________

1. Introduction / Scope
These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern the purchase and delivery of the Axinite Design System Foundation (the "Service") from the Provider to the Client. The Service is a fixed-scope, one-time productized offering that produces deliverables such as token exports, platform runtime outputs, and integration documentation.

By submitting a setup request, checking the consent checkbox during checkout, and authorizing payment, the Client accepts these Terms and enters a binding digital agreement with the Provider.

________________________________________

2. Definitions
- Client: the purchaser (individual or legal entity) who orders the Service.  
- Provider: Miki G., independent operator offering the Service.  
- Deliverables: exported files delivered to the Client (e.g., `tokens.json`, `ads-tokens.css`, platform outputs, README, reference snippets).  
- Acceptance / PASS Criteria:** the technical checks described in the Integration README used to verify correct integration.  
- Validation Window: the 14 days after delivery during which the Client may report mapping or delivery defects for remediation.

________________________________________

3. Service Description
The Service includes:
- Exported design tokens (`tokens.json`) and web runtime (`ads-tokens.css`) for the purchased platform.  
- Integration README and up to five reference components (verification only).  
- No UI redesign, UX consulting, or ongoing maintenance unless separately contracted.

Deliverables are produced based on the design state provided by the Client at the start of the engagement.

**Subsequent updates to design tokens (after delivery) require a new engagement or separately quoted re-sync.**

________________________________________

4. Ordering & Payment
- Price & Currency: Fees are quoted in USD and confirmed before payment.  
- Payment Terms: 100% upfront payment is required to reserve a production slot and begin work. Work begins only after payment clears.  
- Payment Method: Payments are processed via the Provider's payment processor (e.g., Stripe). The Client authorizes a one-time charge when completing checkout.  
- No Work Without Payment:** If payment is not received or is reversed, the Provider has no obligation to deliver.

________________________________________

5. Delivery & Format
- Deliverables are delivered digitally as a versioned archive (e.g., `.zip`) and/or direct links to files.  
- The Provider timestamps the delivery and includes a token version metadata header in runtime files where applicable.  
- The Service is static by design: post-delivery changes in Client design files do not auto-sync.

________________________________________

6. Acceptance, Validation & Remediation
- The Client (or their engineer) must run the PASS checks in the Integration README.  
- The Client has a **14-day Validation Window** from delivery to surface defects that violate the PASS criteria.  
- If a reported defect is attributable to Provider error, the Provider will remediate at no additional cost within a reasonable timeframe (initial response within 24 business hours).  
- Issues caused by subsequent changes to the Client’s design files, environments, or misuse of Deliverables are out of scope and may require a paid re-sync.

________________________________________

7. Refunds & Cancellations
- Because the Service is a fixed-scope, digital, and immediately actionable product, refunds are **not** the default.  
- Refunds are not available after Deliverables have been provided** (i.e., after a delivery archive or direct file links are transmitted to the Client), except in exceptional cases of demonstrable Provider fault.  
- Refunds may be issued at the Provider’s sole discretion in exceptional cases (e.g., inability to perform due to Provider fault).  
- Payment processor fees and transaction costs incurred during the original payment or refund may be deducted from any refund amount.  
- Cancellation before work begins: if the Client cancels prior to production start (payment cleared but before any work), contact the Provider to request cancellation; refunds are handled case-by-case and may be subject to processing fees.

________________________________________

8. Intellectual Property & License
- Client Ownership: Upon full payment, the Client owns the specific token values and exported Deliverables provided for their engagement (the configuration and exported files).  
- Provider Ownership: The Provider retains all rights, title, and interest in the underlying Axinite engine, templates, scripts, and generation logic used to produce Deliverables.  
- License Grant: The Provider grants the Client a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license** to use, modify, and deploy the delivered artifacts within the Client’s organization.  
- Restrictions: The Client may not resell, sublicense, or redistribute the Axinite engine, methodology, or Deliverables as a standalone product or competing service.

________________________________________

9. Confidentiality
- Both parties agree not to disclose confidential information obtained during the engagement. Confidential information includes non-public design assets, mappings, and the Provider’s internal mapping logic.  
- The mutual confidentiality obligation survives delivery and termination.

________________________________________

10. Data Access & Privacy
- The Provider requires **Viewer** access to Client Figma files only; no edit access is requested.  
- The Provider follows a Zero-Retention policy: temporary working files and access are revoked/deleted within 7 days of final delivery unless otherwise agreed.  
- The Provider does not use tracking pixels, analytics, or third-party telemetry on Client materials. See the Provider’s Privacy Policy for details.

________________________________________

11. Warranties & Disclaimers
- Deliverables are provided **"as is"**. The Provider warrants to deliver the artifacts as described and to remediate Provider-caused defects discovered during the Validation Window.  
- Except for the limited warranty above, the Provider expressly disclaims all other warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

________________________________________

12. Limitation of Liability
- The Provider’s total liability for any claim arising from or relating to these Terms or the Service shall not exceed the fees actually paid by the Client for that specific engagement.  
- In no event will the Provider be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including lost profits or business interruption.

________________________________________

13. Termination
- Either party may terminate for material breach if the breaching party fails to cure within 14 days after written notice.  
- Termination does not relieve the Client of payment obligations for work already performed. Upon termination, the Provider may withhold Deliverables until outstanding fees are paid.  
- Termination does not affect the survivability of confidentiality, IP, or license clauses; those obligations remain in force.**

________________________________________

14. Disputes & Governing Framework
- Parties will attempt to resolve disputes informally via email.  
- Unresolved disputes relating to payment are subject to the payment processor’s dispute resolution procedures.  
- These Terms are governed by the laws of the Provider’s country of residence. For operational clarity, the parties agree that recorded click-wrap consent, payment receipts, and delivery logs constitute binding evidence of the contract.

________________________________________

15. Consent & Electronic Agreement
- The Client’s affirmative actions (checking the consent box and authorizing payment) create a binding electronic agreement under applicable electronic commerce standards. No handwritten signature is required.

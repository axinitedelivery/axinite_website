Terms of Service — Unitary Foundation (System Licensing)
Effective Date: January 7, 2026 Version: 1.0.2-STABLE
This document governs the licensing and usage of artifacts delivered by Unitary Foundation. It is designed to protect both the Client’s investment and Unitary’s proprietary methods.
1. Definitions
•	Client: The entity or individual purchasing the Unitary Foundation service.
•	Unitary: The provider of the Design System Foundation and auditing services.
•	Deliverables: The specific output generated for the Client, including but not limited to tokens.json, mapping-dictionary.md, CSS/Swift/Kotlin exports, and integration documentation.
•	Foundation Core: The proprietary scripts, automation engines, and internal logic owned by Unitary used to generate the Deliverables.
•	Acceptance: The point at which Deliverables meet the defined "Quality Gates" (e.g., error-free runtime output and validated token mapping).
2. Grant of License
Upon receipt of full payment and formal Acceptance, Unitary grants the Client a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, and royalty-free license to use, modify, and deploy the Deliverables within the Client’s internal systems and commercial products. This license includes the right for the Client’s contractors and affiliates to use the Deliverables solely for the Client’s benefit.
3. Intellectual Property & Ownership
•	Client Ownership: The Client retains all rights to their original design source (Figma files and assets).
•	Unitary Ownership: Unitary retains exclusive ownership of the Foundation Core (the "engine") and any pre-existing templates or scripts.
•	Output Ownership: The Client owns the specific values and configuration of the delivered tokens, but not the underlying generator logic.
4. Commercial Terms & Activation
•	Fees: The standard Foundation fee is USD 3,000 per platform/theme, unless otherwise specified in a custom quote.
•	Activation: License rights granted in Section 2 are conditional and only become active once full payment has cleared.
•	Audit Validity: Technical conclusions and artifacts are valid for 14 days from the date of delivery, based on the specific design state at that time.
5. Usage Restrictions
•	Redistribution: The Client may not resell or redistribute the Deliverables as a standalone design system or competing product.
•	Scope: The license is limited to the platforms and themes purchased (e.g., iOS/Light Mode). Expansion to additional platforms requires a separate engagement.
6. Liability & Warranty
•	Limited Warranty: Unitary warrants that Deliverables will materially conform to the "Quality Gates" at the time of delivery.
•	Disclaimer: Beyond the limited warranty, Deliverables are provided "as is." Unitary is not liable for implementation errors within the Client’s codebase.
•	Liability Cap: Total liability is limited to the amount of fees actually paid by the Client for the specific engagement.
7. Confidentiality & NDAs
Unitary treats all Client design sources as strictly confidential. If the Client selects the "NDA Required" option during intake, the Figma URL must not be submitted until a formal Non-Disclosure Agreement is executed by both parties.
8. Termination & Transfer
•	Succession: The Client may transfer this license to a successor entity during a company sale or merger, provided Unitary is notified in writing.
•	Breach: Either party may terminate the agreement if a material breach is not cured within 14 days of notice.
9. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand, and any disputes shall be resolved within that jurisdiction.

01\. IDENTITY \& ENGAGEMENT MODEL



Axinite is a productized, fixed-scope design-engineering service operated by Miki G., an independent individual working internationally.

By submitting a setup request, checking the consent box, and completing payment, the Client enters into a binding digital agreement (“click-wrap agreement”) governed by these Terms.

No handwritten or scanned signature is required.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



02\. SCOPE OF SERVICE (FIXED \& DETERMINISTIC)



The service provides a one-time Design System Foundation setup, including:



• Exported design tokens (tokens.json)

• Platform-specific outputs (CSS / Swift / Kotlin, as purchased)

• Integration README

• Up to 5 reference UI components for validation only



Explicit exclusions:

• UI/UX redesign or cleanup

• Product strategy or visual direction

• Ongoing maintenance or consulting

• Additional platforms, themes, or densities not purchased



Anything outside this scope requires a separate agreement.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





03\. DATA ACCESS, PRIVACY \& SECURITY



To ensure a low-friction and secure workflow:



• Access Level: Viewer-only access to Client Figma files

• Data Minimization: Only visual system values (colors, spacing, typography, effects) are reviewed

• No Layout Retention: No product layouts or proprietary structures are duplicated or stored

• Zero-Retention Policy: All temporary data and access are revoked within 7 days of final delivery

• No Tracking: No cookies, analytics, pixels, or behavioral tracking are used

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



04\. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY \& LICENSE



• Client Ownership: Upon full payment, the Client owns the specific values and exported files delivered (tokens, mappings, and platform code).

• Provider Ownership: The Provider retains exclusive ownership of all internal logic, templates, scripts, and generation systems (“Axinite engine”).

• License Grant: The Client receives a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, and distribute the delivered artifacts within their own products and organization.

• Restriction: The Client may not resell, sublicense, or commercialize the Axinite system, architecture, or methodology as a competing product or service.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



05\. CONFIDENTIALITY (MUTUAL)



By initiating the engagement, both parties agree to a mutual confidentiality obligation:



• The Provider will not disclose Client brand values, internal names, or source files.

• The Client will not disclose or reverse-engineer Axinite’s internal architecture, mappings, or system logic for third-party replication.



This obligation survives delivery.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



06\. COMMERCIAL TERMS \& PAYMENT



• Currency: USD

• Payment: 100% upfront, required to secure a production slot

• Pricing: Fixed and disclosed before payment

• Delivery: Digital delivery via versioned .zip archive

• Start Condition: Work begins only after payment has cleared



Failure to complete payment results in no obligation to deliver.



07\. ACCEPTANCE, WARRANTY \& CHANGE WINDOW



• The Deliverables are considered accepted upon delivery if they meet the documented integration outputs.

• A 14-day validation window is provided to confirm compatibility with the Client’s current design files.

• Changes to source designs after delivery are out of scope and may require a paid re-sync.



Deliverables are otherwise provided “as is.”

08\. LIABILITY LIMITATION



• The Provider is not responsible for errors introduced during Client-side implementation.

• Total liability is strictly limited to the amount paid for the specific engagement.

• No indirect, incidental, or consequential damages are assumed.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



09\. DISPUTES \& GOVERNING FRAMEWORK



This is an international, digital-only service.



• Any disputes shall first be resolved informally via email.

• Unresolved disputes are handled exclusively through the payment processor’s dispute resolution system (e.g., Stripe).

• The recorded click-wrap consent, payment receipt, and delivery logs constitute binding evidence of agreement.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



10\. CONSENT \& ENFORCEMENT



Agreement to these Terms is confirmed via explicit checkbox consent and payment authorization.

This action constitutes a legally binding electronic agreement in accordance with applicable international e-commerce standards.

Privacy Protocol — Unitary Audit

Purpose This document explains how Unitary collects, stores, uses, and deletes information submitted through the Audit request form — specifically Figma URLs, email addresses, and any optional attachments. The language is direct: it describes what will happen to the data you supply and what control you have over it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1\. What is collected

•	Figma URL(s) — the link(s) you provide to enable the verification of design tokens and reference components. Can be a view-only link or a specific file URL.

•	Contact email — the address where the audit result and follow-up communication will be sent.

•	Form fields — short answers such as platform, estimated token count, desired outcome, and optional notes.

•	Optional attachments — screenshots or exported files you deliberately upload.

All fields are explicitly requested to perform the audit. No other personal data is required.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2\. How the data is used

•	Primary purpose: to perform the requested audit and to produce the structured result email (Option A/B/C). This is the only operational use.

•	Verification: the Figma URL is opened only to inspect the token usage and to produce verification artifacts. No design work or editing is performed unless agreed separately.

•	Follow-up: the contact email is used to deliver the audit result, any remediation offers (Cleanup Pack), and billing communications if you decide to proceed.

No data is used for marketing, analytics, or training models unless you explicitly opt in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3\. Access \& minimisation

•	Limited access: only the delivery owner (the person performing the audit) and any explicitly named subcontractors will access submitted files. Access is granted strictly on a need-to-know basis.

•	Least privilege: Figma links are accessed in view-only mode whenever possible. If deeper access is required, consent will be requested.

•	No broad sharing: Figma URLs and attachments are not published, posted, or shared with third parties except as required to fulfill the audit and only with your prior consent.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4\. NDAs and sensitive requests

•	If an NDA is requested, the form will mark Figma URL as optional. The audit process pauses until a signed NDA is in place. After the NDA is returned, a request for the Figma link will be sent.

•	The signed NDA becomes part of the project record and is stored alongside the audit request.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

5\. Storage, encryption, and retention

•	Short-term artifacts (audit materials): Figma URLs, screenshots, and temporary exports are stored in encrypted storage for up to 90 days after delivery to allow verification and support.

•	Billing \& records: if the engagement proceeds, invoice and transaction records are retained for 2 years for accounting and dispute resolution.

•	Encryption: data at rest and data in transit are protected by industry-standard encryption when using recommended third-party services (HTTPS, cloud storage provider encryption).

•	Backups: snapshots and backups may exist; deletion requests may take up to 30 days to fully propagate through backups.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6\. Sharing with third-parties / service providers

The following limited sharing may occur to operate the service. Each is listed so you can judge risk: - E-sign services (HelloSign, Dropbox Sign, DocuSign): used only for NDA signing. - Payment processors (Stripe, Wave): used only for invoicing and payments if the engagement proceeds. - Cloud storage / hosting: temporary storage of exported artifacts and generated files. Access is governed by strong access controls.

No marketing vendors or unrelated analytics providers are granted access to submitted design files.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

7\. Your choices \& controls

•	Skip Figma if NDA required: check the NDA option. The audit will not begin until NDA is signed and the Figma link is received.

•	Withdraw a submission: request deletion by emailing the contact address (see Section 10). Short-term artifacts will be removed within 5 business days, with full removal from backups within 30 days.

•	Limit visibility: provide view-only links or redact private pages in Figma before submission.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

8\. What happens after the audit

•	The audit result (Option A / B / C) is delivered to the contact email and is valid for 14 days based on the Figma source submitted.

•	If you proceed to paid work, the minimum commercial terms and retention rules for invoices apply.

9\. Security incidents

If a data breach affecting submitted audit materials occurs, you will be notified within 72 hours with a summary of what data was impacted and the remediation steps taken.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

10\. Data deletion \& contact

To request deletion of your submitted audit materials or to ask questions about data handling, email:

privacy@unitary.example (replace with the delivery contact email you use)

Include: project name, submission date, and the contact email used in the form.

Deletion timeline: - Acknowledgement: within 2 business days. - Primary deletion: within 5 business days. - Backup propagation complete: up to 30 days.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

11\. Minimal cookies / analytics

The audit form itself does not require cookies. If basic analytics are used on the marketing site, design file links and emails are not sent to analytics providers.

12\. Changes to this protocol

This protocol can be updated. The version date is recorded on the top of the public PDF. Each published update will list what changed. If changes materially affect previously received audit submissions, a notice will be sent to the email address on file.

Short summary (for form footer): > Submitted links and emails are used only to perform the audit. They are stored securely and removed on request. The audit result is valid for 14 days.

01\. PURPOSE \& PRINCIPLES



This Privacy Policy defines how Axinite handles Client data during the delivery

of a fixed-scope design system infrastructure service.



Axinite operates on three core principles:



• Data minimization

• Zero retention

• No tracking



Only the minimum data required to deliver the contracted artifacts is accessed.

No Client data is sold, analyzed, or reused for secondary purposes.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



02\. DATA CONTROLLER



Axinite is operated by \*\*Miki G.\*\*, acting as an independent individual providing

digital services internationally.



All data access and processing decisions are made solely to fulfill the

contracted service.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



03\. DATA WE ACCESS



During an engagement, Axinite may access:



• Client-provided Figma files (Viewer access only)

• Visual system values (colors, spacing, typography, effects)

• Client contact information required for delivery and communication



Axinite explicitly does \*\*not\*\* access:



• End-user or customer data

• Product logic or backend systems

• Credentials, secrets, or authentication data

• Analytics, metrics, or behavioral data



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



04\. HOW DATA IS USED



Accessed data is used exclusively to:



• Audit visual system values

• Generate design tokens and mappings

• Produce platform-specific outputs

• Validate integration correctness



Data is never used for:



• Marketing or outreach

• Profiling or analytics

• Training models or automated systems

• Any purpose unrelated to the contracted service



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



05\. DATA STORAGE \& RETENTION



Axinite follows a \*\*Zero-Retention Workflow\*\*:



• No Client source files are permanently stored

• Temporary working files may exist during production only

• All temporary data, access links, and working copies are deleted

  within \*\*7 days\*\* of final delivery



Clients may request confirmation of deletion at any time.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



06\. TRACKING, COOKIES \& ANALYTICS



Axinite does not use:



• Cookies

• Tracking pixels

• Third-party analytics

• Session recording tools

• Behavioral monitoring



The service operates without user tracking or telemetry.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



07\. DATA SHARING \& SUBPROCESSORS



• Client data is never sold or shared

• No subcontractors or third-party processors are involved

• All work is performed directly by the Provider



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



08\. SECURITY PRACTICES



To reduce exposure and risk:



• Viewer-only access to design files

• No persistent credentials stored

• No cloud synchronization of Client files

• Local, task-scoped processing only



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



09\. CLIENT RIGHTS



Clients may request:



• Clarification of what data was accessed

• Confirmation of data deletion

• Immediate revocation of access



Requests are handled via direct email communication.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



10\. POLICY SCOPE



This Privacy Policy applies only to:



• Axinite’s audit process

• Token generation workflow

• Delivered artifacts



Client-side implementation, hosting environments, and runtime behavior

are outside the scope of this policy.
